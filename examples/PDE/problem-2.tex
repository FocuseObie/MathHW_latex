Prove the comparison principle for the diffusion equation: If $u$ and $v$ are
two solutions, and if $u \leq  v$ for $t = 0$, for $x = 0$, and for $x = l$, then $u \leq   v$
for $0 \leq   t < \infty ,\ 0 \leq x \leq   l$.\\

Taking $w=v-u$ as a solution, the max-min states that the minimum is obtained on the boundaries, and $w \geq  0$ on the boundaries, the the minium for the whole solution must be $\geq  0$ thus $v-u \geq  0 \implies  v \geq  u$.
